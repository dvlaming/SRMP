# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome! In these pages you will find tutorial materials for the PPLE Skills and Research Methods for Psychology tutorials. In session 2025/26, we will be working with JASP which can be downloaded [here](https://jasp-stats.org/download/).

Every tutorial page will feature a video demonstrations and a download link for the dataset used in the video. Although not part of the course this year, code to run the featured analyses in the R programming language R [@baseR] will also be included, for the curious.
